msgid "The primary tool for monitoring the status of the cluster is crm_mon (also available as crm status). It can be run in a variety of modes and has a number of output options. To find out about any of the tools that come with Pacemaker, simply invoke them with the --help option or consult the included man pages. Both sets of output are created from the tool, and so will always be in sync with each other and the tool itself."
