== Using Pacemaker Tools ==

In the dark past, configuring Pacemaker required the administrator to
read and write XML. In true UNIX style, there were also a number of
different commands that specialized in different aspects of querying
and updating the cluster.

Since Pacemaker 1.0, this has all changed and we have an integrated,
scriptable, cluster shell that hides all the messy XML scaffolding. It
even allows you to queue up several changes at once and commit them
atomically.

Take some time to familiarize yourself with what it can do.

pass:[# <command>crm --help</command>]
------------------
sys::[crm --help]
------------------

The primary tool for monitoring the status of the cluster is crm_mon
(also available as crm status). It can be run in a variety of modes
and has a number of output options. To find out about any of the tools
that come with Pacemaker, simply invoke them with the --help option or
consult the included man pages. Both sets of output are created from
the tool, and so will always be in sync with each other and the tool
itself.

Additionally, the Pacemaker version and supported cluster stack(s) are
available via the --feature option to pacemakerd.

pass:[# <command>pacemakerd --features</command>]
------------------
sys::[pacemakerd --features]
------------------


pass:[# <command>pacemakerd --help</command>]
------------------
sys::[pacemakerd --help]
------------------


pass:[# <command>crm_mon --help</command>]
------------------
sys::[crm_mon --help]
------------------

[NOTE]
======
If the SNMP and/or email options are not listed, then Pacemaker was not
built to support them. This may be by the choice of your distribution or
the required libraries may not have been available. Please contact
whoever supplied you with the packages for more details.
